# NLP
Here I have tried with four different applications of Natural Language Processing. Those are- Spam Classification, Sentiment Analysis, WordCloud and Customer Segmentation. I applied K-Means and Hierarchical clustering in creating Descriptive Unsupervised analysis. I developed WordCloud on spam dataset using python. I built Sentiment Analysis model using two different approaches: Traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Using Keras and deep learning pipeline I achieved 87.93% accuracy. Soon, I will be uploading spam classification problem using traditional machine learning and deep learning-LSTM approach.
